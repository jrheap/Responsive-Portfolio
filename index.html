            I was born and raised in West Valley City, Utah. I moved to the south end of the Salt Lake Valley and have been there ever since. <br>
            I have been married to Kenzie for a year and a half. no kids yet but we have TWO fur babies, yeah i said two not just one but two! but they are awesome! <br>
            The oldest pup's name is Willow, she is a German Shepard. The next is Maverick, he is a German shepard husky mix.

           I love the Mountains, whether I am sitting on the mountain side on a cold, brisk opening day of the deer hunt or flying through them on a dirt bike. <br>
               I just cant get enough of the Moiutains. Taking the dogs camping is always an interesting adventure.

           I try to be out going all the time but it doesnt work all the time...(Mostly i am just awkward) I love learning new things, and love trying to figure out how things work.<br>
           You'll often see me staring at the most random thing, i am just trying to figure out how it was built or what makes it work. I already know its weird so its ok judge me on that!
