            I was born and raised in West Valley City, Utah. I moved to the south end of the Salt Lake Valley and have been there ever since. <br>
            I have been married to Kenzie for two years and we are EXPECTING our first child. We also have 2 dogs, Willow and Maverick.

           I love the Mountains, whether I am hiking, hunting, fishing, or just simply being.<br>
               I just cant get enough of the Mountains. Taking the dogs camping is always an interesting adventure.

        I am a full-stack Web Developer with a passion for building and creating. I understand the importance of writing clean, fast, readable and reliable code. I am hard working, I excel in challenging situations, and love learning.
